## üîß **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Backend Issues**
- If routing fails, the system automatically uses enhanced fallback algorithms
- All endpoints have comprehensive error handling
- Mock data ensures demos work even without full backend

### **Frontend Issues**
- Light mode is default (as requested)
- Notifications only show when clicked
- All animations are optimized for performance

### **API Testing**
```bash
# Test individual endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/routes/locations
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/routes/calculate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"start_location":"main_ghat","end_location":"mahakal_temple","route_type":"optimal"}'
```
